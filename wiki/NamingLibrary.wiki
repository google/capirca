#summary Naming Library Usage
= Introduction =

The naming library is used by the capirca system to parse definitions of network and service data.  These definitions are based on 'tokens' that are used in the high-level policy language.

= Basic Usage =

*Create a directory to hold the definitions files*
{{{
mkdir /path/to/definitions/directory
}}}
*Create network definitions files*

_(network defintions files must end in '.net')_
{{{
cat > /path/to/definitions/directory/NETWORKS.net

INTERNAL = 10.0.0.0/8     # RFC1918
           172.16.0.0/12  # RFC1918
           192.168.0.0/16 # RFC1918
WEBSERVERS = 200.3.2.1/32 # webserver-1
             200.3.2.4/32 # webserver-2
MAILSERVER = 200.3.2.5/32 # mailserver-1

^D
}}}
*Create service definitions files*

_(service defintions files must end in '.svc')_
{{{
cat > /path/to/definitions/directory/SERVICES.svc

HTTP = 80/tcp  # web traffic
MAIL = 25/tcp  # smtp port
       465/tcp # smtp over ssl
DNS = 53/tcp
      53/udp

^D
}}}
*Create a naming object*
{{{
from capirca import naming

defs = naming.Naming('/path/to/definitions/directory')
}}}
*Access Definitions From the Naming Object*
{{{
defs.GetNet('INTERNAL')

defs.GetService('MAIL')

defs.GetServiceByProto('DNS','udp')
}}}



= Methods =

*GetIpParents(self, query)*
    Return network tokens that contain IP in query.
     
    Args:
      query: an ip string ('10.1.1.1') or nacaddr.IP object
     
    Returns:
      rval2: a list of tokens containing this IP

*GetNet(self, query)*
    Expand a network token into a list of nacaddr.IP objects.
     
    Args:
      query: Network definition token which may include comment text
     
    Raises:
      BadNetmaskTypeError: Results when an unknown netmask_type is
      specified.  Acceptable values are 'cidr', 'netmask', and 'hostmask'.
     
    Returns:
      List of nacaddr.IP objects
     
    Raises:
      UndefinedAddressError: for an undefined token value

*GetNetAddr(self, token)*
    Given a network token, return a list of nacaddr.IP objects.
     
    Args:
      token: A name of a network definition, such as 'INTERNAL'
     
    Returns:
      A list of nacaddr.IP objects.
     
    Raises:
      UndefinedAddressError: if the network name isn't defined.

*GetService(self, query)*
    Given a service name, return a list of associated ports and protocols.
     
    Args:
      query: Service name symbol or token.
     
    Returns:
      A list of service values such as ['80/tcp', '443/tcp', '161/udp', ...]

*GetServiceByProto(self, query, proto)*
    Given a service name, return list of ports in the service by protocol.
     
    Args:
      query: Service name to lookup.
      proto: A particular protocol to restrict results by, such as 'tcp'.
     
    Returns:
      A list of service values of type 'proto', such as ['80', '443', ...]

*GetServiceParents(self, query)*
    Given a service, return any tokens containing the value.
     
    Args:
      query: a service or token name, such as 53/tcp or DNS
     
    Returns:
      rval2: a list of tokens that contain query or parents of query

*ParseNetworkList(self, data)*
    Take an array of network data and import into class.
     
    This method allows us to pass an array of data that contains network
    definitions that are appended to any definitions read from files.
     
    Args:
      data: array of text lines containing net definitions.

*ParseServiceList(self, data)*
    Take an array of service data and import into class.
     
    This method allows us to pass an array of data that contains service
    definitions that are appended to any definitions read from files.
     
    Args:
      data: array of text lines containing service definitions.
