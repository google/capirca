comment: |-
  Denies all traffic to internal IPs except established tcp replies.
  Also denies access to certain public allocations.
  Ideal for some internal lab/testing types of subnets that are
  not well trusted, but allowing internal users to access.
  Apply to ingress interface (to filter traffic coming from lab)
