# Arista Traffic-Policy Use Notes

## supported tokens

The following tokens are supported:
- `action`
- `comment`
- `counter`
- `destination-address`
- `destination-exclude`
- `destination-port`
- `destination-prefix` - this should resolve to a configured field-set in
  traffic-policy format.
- `dscp-set`
- `fragment-offset`
- `icmp-type`
- `logging`
- `option`
  - `established`
  - `tcp-established`
  - `initial`
  - `rst`
  - `first-fragment` - this  will be rendered as a `fragment` match.`
- `packet-length`
- `source-address`
- `source-exclude`
- `source-port`
- `source-prefix` - this should resolve to a configured field-set in
  traffic-policy format.
- `traffic-class`
- `verbatim`

## documentation

The official documentation for traffic-policies can be found at the following URL.

## filter types

Traffic-policies are dual-address-family by default (i.e.: mixed). A term may be
either of type ipv4 or ipv6. If the filter type is defined as mixed (the
default), then match/action statements for each address family will be
generated.

If the operator wishes to create an ipv4 or ipv6 only filter, the inet and inet6
tokens within the header will be honored and only addresses from the respective
address family will be rendered. However, EOS will still, by default, create an
'ipvX-default-all' term for the alternate address family. (see below)

## action

The fully supported actions are: `accept`, and `deny`. Use of `reject`, or
`reject-with-tcp-rst` will result in the generation of deny actions in the
rendered traffic policy.

Note, within traffic-policies not configuring an explicit `deny` action (or
`reject` variant) will result in an implicit allow for a term.

### counters

- If counters are specified in a term, a traffic-policy named-counter stanza
  will be generated in the rendered output.
- Counter names should not contain a (`.`). If a (`.`) is embedded in a counter
  name it will be replaced w/a dash (`-`).

### (source|destination)-address-exclude

Currently, (as of Jan-2021), EOS does not support the use of 'except' inline
within match statements. If an exclude/except token is used, a traffic-policy
field-set will be generated and referenced in the match-term output. This
field-set will be named `<direction>-<term.name>` where direction is either
**src** or **dst** depending on the direction of the token in use.

If the filter type is mixed, both address-families will have the respective
field-sets generated. The field-set for the ipv4 address family will have the
field-set generated with no prefix, while the ipv6 field-set will have `ipv6`
inserted into the field-set name after the direction and before the name.
(form: `src|dst-ipv6-term_name`)

## using field-sets

Arista traffic policies can be generated with source or destination prefixes
directly embedded within the match conditions.  If any prefixes are to be
excluded from the match, the generator uses field-sets to contain the prefixes.
Alternatively, a `field-set` flag in the header can force the generator to
always use field-sets for prefix definitions, even when direct nesting under
match conditions would otherwise be possible.

The generator also removes any duplicate field-sets and their associated
references within the policy.

### Sample Policy with unique field-sets

      field-set ipv6 prefix src-ipv6-term-1
        2001:4860:4860::8888/128
        2001:4860:4860::8844/128
      !
      traffic-policy policy-1
        match src-ipv6-term-1 ipv6
          destination prefix field-set src-ipv6-term-1
          protocol udp destination port 53
      !
        match src-ipv6-term-2 ipv6
          destination prefix field-set src-ipv6-term-1
          protocol icmp type 0,3,8,11,12 code all
      !

## ports

In EOS traffic-policies, ports can be configured using:

- `source [ all | port-list | field-set ]`
- `destination [ all | port-list | field-set ]`

Currently, all and field-sets are not supported for ports. Only port-lists are
supported.

## traffic-class

An optional traffic class can be set in the action block with a value between 0
and 7.

- `set traffic class <0-7>`

## dscp-set

DSCP can be set in the action block with decimal values ranging between 0 and 63.

- `set dscp <0-63>`

## default-terms

EOS has (2) default terms per traffic-policy, one for each address family:

- `ipv4-default-all`
- `ipv6-default-all`

If there is no match criteria associated with a term _and_ the term name in the
policy begins with `default-`, the contents will be rendered into the default
terms for the appropriate address family.

## empty match criteria

if there is no match criteria specified, and the term name does _not_ start with
`default-` the term will not be rendered and a warning will be logged.
