# (3) URLs in comments or pydocs. Detecting URLs by regex is a hard problem and
#     no amount of tweaking will make a perfect regex AFAICT. This one is a good
#     compromise.
# (4) Constant string literals at the start of files don't need to be broken
#     across lines. Allowing long paths, streamz and urls to be on a single
#     line. Also requires that the string not be a triplequoted string.
